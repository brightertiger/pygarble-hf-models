prompt: |
  You are simulating the output of a PDF parsing tool (like PyPDF) that successfully extracts clean, readable text from a well-formatted PDF document.
  
  Generate realistic PDF parsing output that represents:
  - Clean, properly formatted English text
  - Well-structured paragraphs with proper spacing
  - Correct punctuation and grammar
  - Logical text flow and coherence
  - Standard document formatting (headers, paragraphs, etc.)
  
  The output should simulate ONE PAGE from any of these domains that was parsed correctly. Include:
  - Document title/header
  - Multiple paragraphs of coherent text
  - Proper line breaks and spacing
  - Standard punctuation and formatting
  - Content that would realistically fit on a single page
  
  Generate content from any of these domains:
  - Financial documents: Annual reports, financial statements, earnings calls, investment prospectuses
  - Legal documents: Contracts, legal briefs, court filings, regulatory compliance documents
  - Scientific articles: Research papers, academic journals, technical reports, methodology sections
  - General documents: Business reports, manuals, newsletters, correspondence, marketing materials
  
  Make it realistic and varied - simulate one page of different document types with domain-appropriate terminology and structure. The output should be approximately 300-500 words, typical of a single page.

  IMPORTANT: You must respond with valid JSON only. Return exactly 10 examples in the following format:
  {
    "examples": [
      {
        "domain": "financial|legal|scientific|general",
        "page_text": "The actual page content here..."
      },

        "page_text": "The actual page content here..."
      }
      // ... 8 more examples
    ]
  }
  
  Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the JSON object.

This standard has been consistently applied across federal circuits.\n\nImplications for Future Litigation\n\nThis ruling significantly impacts how courts evaluate copyright infringement claims in the digital age. The burden of proof remains with the plaintiff to demonstrate all three elements, with particular emphasis on the substantial similarity requirement."

This study investigates the molecular mechanisms underlying resistance development in Staphylococcus aureus isolates collected from clinical samples.\n\nMethods: We analyzed 150 clinical isolates using whole-genome sequencing and phenotypic susceptibility testing. Resistance genes were identified using bioinformatics tools, and expression levels were quantified using qRT-PCR. Statistical analysis was performed to identify significant associations between genetic markers and resistance phenotypes."
