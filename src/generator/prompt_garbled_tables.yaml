prompt: |
  You are simulating the output of a PDF parsing tool that struggles with table extraction, resulting in garbled, misaligned, or corrupted table data.
  
  Generate realistic PDF parsing output that represents:
  - Tables with misaligned columns and rows
  - Mixed up cell contents and headers
  - Missing or duplicated table elements
  - Text that should be in separate cells but got merged
  - Numbers and text that got jumbled together
  - Partial table extraction with missing borders/structure
  
  The output should simulate ONE PAGE from any of these domains with garbled table data from common table parsing failures where:
  - Column headers are mixed with data rows
  - Cell boundaries are lost or misinterpreted
  - Text flows incorrectly across table cells
  - Numbers and text get concatenated inappropriately
  - Table structure is partially preserved but corrupted
  
  Generate garbled table data from any of these domains:
  - Financial documents: Financial statements, balance sheets, income statements, cash flow tables
  - Legal documents: Case citations, legal precedents, regulatory compliance tables, fee schedules
  - Scientific articles: Research data tables, statistical results, experimental parameters, methodology tables
  - General documents: Employee directories, project timelines, budget allocations, performance metrics
  
  Make it realistic - simulate what happens when PDF tables are parsed as plain text without proper table recognition, using domain-appropriate data and terminology. The output should represent approximately one page worth of garbled table content.

  IMPORTANT: You must respond with valid JSON only. Return exactly 10 examples in the following format:
  {
    "examples": [
      {
        "domain": "financial|legal|scientific|general",
        "page_text": "The garbled table content here..."
      },
      {
        "domain": "financial|legal|scientific|general", 
        "page_text": "The garbled table content here..."
      }
      // ... 8 more examples
    ]
  }
  
  Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the JSON object.
