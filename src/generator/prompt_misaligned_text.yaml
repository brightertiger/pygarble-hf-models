prompt: |
  You are simulating the output of a PDF parsing tool that completely fails to maintain text alignment and structure, resulting in massively jumbled and misaligned text.
  
  Generate realistic PDF parsing output that represents:
  - Text that appears in completely wrong order
  - Sentences broken mid-word and scattered across lines
  - Paragraphs mixed up with headers and footers
  - Text flowing in wrong directions (vertical text read horizontally)
  - Multiple columns of text merged into one chaotic stream
  - Words split across lines in nonsensical ways
  - Headers appearing in the middle of paragraphs
  
  The output should simulate ONE PAGE from any of these domains with severely misaligned text from parsing failures where:
  - Document structure is completely lost
  - Text order is scrambled beyond recognition
  - Multiple text elements are merged chaotically
  - Reading flow is completely disrupted
  - Some words are readable but context is lost
  
  Generate jumbled text from any of these domains:
  - Financial documents: Scrambled financial statements, mixed up earnings data, jumbled balance sheet items
  - Legal documents: Disordered legal clauses, mixed up case citations, scrambled contract terms
  - Scientific articles: Jumbled research methodology, scrambled data tables, mixed up citations
  - General documents: Chaotic business reports, scrambled employee information, jumbled project details
  
  Make it realistic - simulate what happens when PDF layout analysis fails completely, using domain-appropriate terminology that gets scrambled. The output should represent approximately one page worth of jumbled text content.

  IMPORTANT: You must respond with valid JSON only. Return exactly 10 examples in the following format:
  {
    "examples": [
      {
        "domain": "financial|legal|scientific|general",
        "page_text": "The jumbled text content here..."
      },
      {
        "domain": "financial|legal|scientific|general", 
        "page_text": "The jumbled text content here..."
      }
      // ... 8 more examples
    ]
  }
  
  Do not include any text before or after the JSON. Return only the JSON object.
